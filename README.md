# FusionCalcCSharpRedux

Moving forward I'll be using this respostiroy for my [C# Fusion Calculator](https://github.com/PierreT12/FusionCalculatorCSharp) devlopment. The old one is quiet a mess so I thought it be better to start from scratch to make it look nicer overall.  

This is just taking what I did in my C++ calcualtor and reimplementing the code back into C#. 

Again please look at this or my [C++](https://github.com/PierreT12/FusionCalculatorCpp) project if you want to see what I can do.
